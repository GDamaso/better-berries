# Fork from QuackStack's capstone project 2024

This project was sponsored by the sustainment team and is now in their github archived repos.
I'm only updating it to deploy a basic version for demonstration purposes and perhaps fix some bugs in the meanwhile.
In this process, I will remove many resources I find not to be integral for this minimal deployment.

Please note: **This project is not anymore sponsored by the BC Government and I currently have no employment status with them in any shape or form.**

# Welcome to the Quackstack Team Capstone Project ðŸš€

## Our Mission

We're embarking on a journey to develop a mobile-first, intuitive, and modern web application inspired by the BC Government NMP Calculator (https://nmp.apps.nrs.gov.bc.ca/). Our intent is to make a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) based on the current NMP Calculator.
